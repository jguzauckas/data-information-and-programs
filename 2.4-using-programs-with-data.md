# Section 2.4 - Using Programs with Data

## Programs + Data

Programs can be used to process data to acquire information.

- Youâ€™ve done this with the college admissions project!

Tables, diagrams, text, and other visual tools can be used to communicate insight and knowledge gained from data.

- Think about how much easier a graph is to read than a set of numbers.

## Searching and Filtering

Search tools are useful for efficiently finding information.

- CTRL + F on your computer!

Data filtering systems are important tools for finding information and recognizing patterns in data.

- Filtering means only looking at certain information instead of all of it at once, making it easier to check certain information.

Programs such as spreadsheets help efficiently organize and find trends in information.

- The concept of a table is critical, having the information clearly organized.

## Extracting Information from Data

Some processes that can be used to extract or modify information from data include the following:

- Transforming every element of a data set, such as doubling every element in a list, or adding a parent's email to every student record.

- Filtering a data set, such as keeping only the positive numbers from a list, or keeping only students who signed up for band from a record of all the students.

- Combining or comparing data in some way, such as adding up a list of numbers, or finding the student who has the highest GPA.

- Visualizing a data set through a chart, graph, or other visual representation.

## Programmers Have the Power

Programs are used in an iterative and interactive way when processing information to allow users to gain insight and knowledge about data.

- Since we write the program, we can decide what direction to go with the information we are processing!

Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.

- Imagine having a program clean up all the dates from earlier.

Combining data sources, clustering data, and classifying data are parts of the process of using programs to gain insight and knowledge from data.

## Transforming Data

Insight and knowledge can be obtained from translating and transforming digitally represented information.

- Changing how data looks can help change your perspective.

Patterns can emerge when data are transformed using programs.

- Different perspectives can lead to different patterns becoming apparent.

## Work

Go back and look at your College Admissions Project. Write 3 sentences about how that project relates to this material

-

Go through the two sources below to learn about data filtering and transformation. After going through each source, write 3 sentences about what you thought was interesting about it.

Sample Response:

[Crash Course Computer Science - Data Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtDxDvCpPL4) - I thought it was interesting how you combine three primary colors in proportions to create other colors. The fact that you don't need to save every single pixel's color to recreate an image with a lot of accuracy seems counterintuitive. Comparing frames of videos seems like an intuitive way to determine what information is redundant in a video.
