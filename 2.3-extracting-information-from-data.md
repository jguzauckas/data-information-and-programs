# Section 2.3 - Extracting Information from Data

## Data vs. Information

Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data.

- Data is the raw bits and bytes in the computer, information is what we as humans do with the data.

Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections, and addressing problems.

This is typically called data analysis or data science.

## Correlation vs. Causation

Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a causal relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship.

- “Correlation does not equal causation.”

Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion. It may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources to formulate a conclusion.

- This helps to combine perspectives!

## Metadata

Metadata are data about data. For example, the piece of data may be an image, while the metadata may include the date of creation or the file size of the image.

- This is when you right-click on a file and select “Properties”!

Changes and deletions made to metadata do not change the primary data.

- Changing the name of the picture on a computer doesn’t change the picture itself.

Metadata are used for finding, organizing, and managing information.

Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information.

- Sometimes we might decide to eliminate a data point based on the metadata (i.e., date was too long ago)

Metadata allow data to be structured and organized.

## Data Processing

The ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools.

Data sets pose challenges regardless of size, such as:

- The need to clean data
- Incomplete data
- Invalid data
- The need to combine data sources

## Data Cleaning

Depending on how data were collected, they may not be uniform. For example, if users enter data into an open field, the way they choose to abbreviate, spell, or capitalize something may vary from user to user.

- 1/30, 01/30, 1/30/23, 01/30/23, 1/30/2023, 01/30/2023, Jan 30, 2023, January 30, 2023.

Cleaning data is a process that makes the data uniform without changing their meaning (e.g., replacing all equivalent abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the same word).

- Turn all dates into the form of 01/30/2023.

## Bias

Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data.

- Bias could be where you actually collect data from (only from certain sources, or explicitly not from certain sources), the way you collect data (digitally when internet access may be an issue, the way you ask a question is more understandable to a given group of people than others), etc.

## Size

The size of a data set affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it.

- While it isn’t always true, more data will typically lead to more information.

Large data sets are difficult to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems.

- Imagine an algorithm like TikTok that goes through a billion user’s worth of watch history to determine what to show to each person next!

Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored.

- These large companies have specifically designed so that they can scale up their hardware to keep up with the demand!

## Work

For the following conclusions, give one reason why this correlation might not necessarily imply causation.

Since ice cream sales and shark attacks both increase in frequency during the summer, ice cream must cause shark attacks.

-

People who exercise have a strong correlation with people who get skin cancer, so exercise must cause skin cancer.

-

Given the following data, clean them to all be of the same form:

February 10, 2023 ->

Mar 20, 22 ->

06/18/22 ->

8/4/21 ->

10/5/23 ->

Write a Python program that asks the user for a date via the input function and cleans the date provided to follow a standard of your choice. I should be able to enter any sample from above and get a consistent result.
